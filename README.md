about me

My name is Payten Jimenez, I am learning to code and hope to one day get a job as a software developer.
I am currently learning python and will learn new languages soon after.
I like working on projects with teams and seeing the program come to life from just a vision. 
I like coding because I see it as a creative outlet and find that when I spend long hours coding I dont feel guilty after like I do when playing video games or watching youtube.
